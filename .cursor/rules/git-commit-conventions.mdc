# ✅ Git Commit Convention

All commit messages should follow this structure, inspired by the [Conventional Commits](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org) specification:

```
<jira-ticket>: <jira-ticket-subject>
[blank line]
<short description>
```

**Guidelines:**
- **Before commit changes to remote, let the requeter to review commit message first**
- Begin the subject with a **noun**, not a verb.  
  - ✅ Example: `temporary test_and_deploy script to support CI for legacy builds`  
  - ❌ Avoid: `add temporary test_and_deploy script`
- The subject should clearly express the purpose of the change.
- The body (optional) may contain short explanations or bullet points to elaborate on context or reasoning.
- There is no need for a concluding summary.
- ONLY commit and push **staged** changes
- Find out the **relevant Jira ticket** based on branch name
