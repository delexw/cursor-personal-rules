  ```
  <ticket-code>: <subject>
  ```
- **Description Requirements**:
  - Use the template provided in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
  - Ingore uncommited and unstaged files [CRITICAL]
  - Start the description with a link to the **relevant Jira ticket**.
  - Keep the language **clear and concise**, avoiding unnecessary detail.
  - Use **Australian English** where possible.
  - Aim for a **semi-formal to casual tone**—professional but not overly stiff.
  - Find out the **relevant Jira ticket** based on branch name
  - Open the PR in browser after it is created
